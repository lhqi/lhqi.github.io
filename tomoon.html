            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Project Brief</h3>
            <h5><u>Background</u></h5>
            <h5 class="mb-4">In April 2019, I took on a side gig in hopes of gaining more experience in user interface and user experience design. I found the opportunity through a listing on Facebook and sent over my details. I video-chatted with the client and spoke about my design background before being accepted for the contract job. There was a 2-week, 1-feature trial period and upon successful completion, I was on board for the rest of the project. The remainder was broken down into 4 milestones and progress was checked formally at each milestone although communication with the client was constant throughout the entire duration.</h5>
            <h5><u>Problem Statement</u></h5>
            <h5 class="mb-4">Lots of people don't know the best way to deal with their money. How much of it should go towards expenses? How much is supposed to go into a 401(k)? How much can or should one save in an IRA? A lot of people would like to retire early and save or invest their income but simply don't have all the details or don't know the basics of how.</h5>
            <h5><u>The Goal</u></h5>
            <h5 class="mb-4">My client hired me to design a responsive web app that would essentially be a step-by-step guide to help users sort out their finances and save for the future. Users would be able to easily enter in their personal data and choose how much and where they wanted their money to go. At the end of the guide, a final page displays to the user whether or not they can retire early, based on the information they entered previously. If not, it suggests tips on how best to change their responses and tweak their numbers so that they can. </h5>
            <h5><u>Target Audience</u></h5>
            <h5 class="mb-4">My client teaches a course on financial literacy and this is mainly where the app will be used. He hopes to fully publish this app for the public (aimed towards students in the later years of college or young professionals who recently joined the workforce) and educate and aid users on how best to handle their future or current income. </h5>

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">User Research</h3>
            <h5>I did not do any user research for this project as the client provided Excel sheets with responses to an online survey filled out by members of the aforementioned target audience.  During the middle of the project when a potential for A/B testing arose, the client was able to get in contact with those who filled out the survey before and ask their opinions on two potential designs. This aided me in securing a user-tested final design.</h5>

            <h3 class="mt-4 mb-3">Design Solution</h3>
            <h5>The client had a lot of materials for me to go over that talked about financial literacy, the meaning of certain terms, etc. He also passed along an Excel sheet with the content he wanted on the web app with multiple tabs that would later become the different screens. I spent some time going over them all to get a better feel for what users may want from the app and what they didn't like from the Excel prototype of the app.</h5>
            <h5>For my designs, I first started with paper mockups of each of the main pages. I then sent these mockups to the client to ask if that's what was envisioned for each page. Most of the time, we had the same idea. Other times, it was requested that I change a few buttons or the layout of the page and I would send a new paper wireframe over and then iterate until we both agreed on a solution.</h5>
            <h5>The next step was designing these in Sketch.</h5>
            <h5><u>Color System</u></h5>
            <h5>From the client, I obtained the 3 main colors (shades of blue pulled from a logo that had already been created) that would serve as the base. I added in a classic #FFFFFF white as well as a shade of off-white in places where a pure white is either too blinding or unnecessary. This color became the background of the app. Lastly, I had a shade of red as a warning color and a shade of green as a positive, go-ahead color. Both of these were checked to be complementary to the main shades of blue for the app.</h5>
